                        Connecting to a REPL


If liquid is added as a dependency to a project, it is possible to start 
liquid just like a REPL itself, so evaluation is executed in the context of 
the project. If liquid is started as standalone it is still possible to 
connect to an external REPL using

    :jack-in 5555

if for example the port of the REPL is 5555.

Before connecting start the REPL with the command:

    clj -J-Dclojure.server.repl=
                             "{:port 5555 :accept clojure.core.server/repl}"

(It might look a bit different on a Windows machine.)

To disconnect from the REPL use

    :jack-out

To evaluate expressions use F5. The binding c p p still evaluates within the 
editor, while F5 sends to the REPL.
