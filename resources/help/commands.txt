                                 Commands


Commands are activated by typing ":" in normal mode. If for example a file is 
open, it can be saved by typing :w. To quit Liquid type :q or :q! to force 
quit, discarding changes.

Modify commands

    (ns user
      (:require [liq.editor :as editor]
                [liq.buffer :as buffer]))

    (defn move10
      [buf]
      (buffer/right buf 10))

    (defn move10action
      []
      (editor/apply-to-buffer move10))

    (swap! editor/state assoc-in [:liq.editor/commands :move10] move10action)

Now type :move10 in normal mode. Then ENTER. The cursor will move 10 times to 
the right 

The command can also be used for keybinding, like this:

    (editor/add-key-bindings :help-mode :normal {"C-t" :move10})

Example with command taking parameters:

    (ns user
      (:require [liq.editor :as editor]
                [liq.buffer :as buffer]))

    (defn move-n
      [buf n]
      (buffer/right buf n))

    (defn move-n-action
      [& args]
      (let [n (Integer/parseInt (or (first args) "10"))]
        (editor/apply-to-buffer #(move-n % n))))

    (swap! editor/state assoc-in [:liq.editor/commands :moven] move-n-action)

Try it by typing ":moven 20" in normal mode
