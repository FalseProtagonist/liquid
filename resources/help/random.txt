Evaluate code

To evaluate code snippets press: c c p. If selection is active the selected 
code will be executed. (Be aware the selection needs to contain valid code to 
evaluate succesfully.)

If nothing is selected the smallest form containing the cursor will be 
evaluated.

Examples:

    (+ 1 2 (* 3 4)) 

Place the cursor on "1" and press c p p. The result will be 15.

Place the cursor on "3" and press c p p. Onlty the inner form will be 
evaluated with the result 12.

This priciple allows one to evaluate "test" snippets within comment tags, 
like:

    (comment (+ 1 2 (* 3 4)))

Modify keybindings

Below is an example of how to define or redefine a keybinding for an already  
existing mode.

It has been written with all details to make it clear how the parts are 
assembled.

Evaluate the code by selecting everything (of the code) and type c p p. After 
 that pressing C-t (Ctrl+T) the cursor will move 10 times to the right. Try  
it. 

    (ns user
      (:require [liq.editor :as editor]
                [liq.buffer :as buffer]))

    (defn move10
      [buf]
      (buffer/right buf 10))

    (defn move10action
      []
      (editor/apply-to-buffer move10))

    (editor/add-key-bindings :help-mode :normal {"C-t" move10action})
