                            Spacemacs mode 


Spacemacs mode is a mode that add Spacemacs like keybindings. Only few of the 
bindings have been implemented, but enough to provide a structure. If someone 
wants more emplemented, look to see if you can manage it yourself, and create 
a pullrequest. Maybe also write to me with a description of the one you are 
missing.

Spacemacs mode is added to the modelist for any new buffer as default, if 
modes have not been explicitly specified.
