                                Modes

Each major mode (see major-modes.txt) has some modes, which are vim like,
like :normal, :insert, :visual. Through the use of keybindings one can switch
between these modes. So which function a keypress should resolve to is
decided by first reading which mode is active, then finding the first major
mode in the modes list that has the key defined for that mode.

==============================================================================
Example

Here is part of the definition for fundamental-mode:

    {:insert {"C-b" :left
              "C-n" :down}
     :normal {"a" :insert-after-point
              "I" :insert-at-beginning-of-line}}

And here is some custom-mode:

    {:insert "C-b" :up}

Lets say the buffers ::major-modes list is

    (list :custom-mode :fundamental-mode)

If the current mode is :insert and the "C-b" keycombination is pressed, the :up
will be choose, since :custom-mode, as the first mode has "C-b" defined for
:insert mode.

If the current mode is :insert and "C-n" is pressed, the :down action will be
choosen from the :fundamental-mode, since it is not defined for :custom-mode.
