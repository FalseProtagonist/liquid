                            File handling


==============================================================================
Finding files

Finding files or editing files is handles by dired-mode. Activating 
dired-mode is done with the :e command.

The :e command might or might not take parameters. Here are some different 
examples

    :e /tmp/tmp.clj - Will open the file /tmp/tmp.clj
    :e /tmp         - Will open dired-mode with /tmp as current directory.
    :e              - Will open dired-mode with the folder of the current file
                      as current directory.
    :e .            - Will open dired-mode with the folder of the current file
                      as current directory.
    :Ex             - Will open dired-mode with the folder of the current file
                      as current directory.

==============================================================================
Dired mode

Dired mode is a file browser. The content has the form:

    The first line is the current directory shown with green color
    The next lines are the subfolders shown with blue color
    The last lines are the files in the folder

Most keybindings are similar to those for normal mode (See cheatsheet.txt) 
including the search functionality.

ENTER      On a folder. Dired-mode navigates to that folder.
ENTER      On a file. The file is opened for edit.

==============================================================================
Create new file

In dired mode a new file is created by pressing % on the current directory
(green top line). A prompt for filename input will be shown. Enter a name and
press ENTER.
