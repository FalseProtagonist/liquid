                             Word completion


Word provides a typeahead list of suggestions based on the word under the
cursor. The suggestion buffer works like a regular buffer except insert mode
works as a filter.

The suggestions are based on functions from required namespaces and optionally
from a word list.

==============================================================================
Usage

Type something, then press TAB. A buffer is created below the cursor. Continue
typeahead. When the target suggestion is displayed press ESC to enter normal
mode. Now use j and k to move the cursor between the suggestions. Press ENTER
to choose.

Press ESC a couple of times to cancel.

==============================================================================
Specifying wordlist

A wordlist can be specified by setting the setting :word-list-path.

On Linux systems there are usually a wordlist on the path:  

    /usr/share/dict/words

To use is add the following to your .liq file:

    (editor/set-setting :word-list-path "/usr/share/dict/words")
